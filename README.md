# Optimal-Transportation-in-Monge-Kantorovich-Problem
This is the course project for CSE543T at WashU. We explore the application of Optimal Transportation theory in the form of Nonlinear Monge-Kantorovich Problem, and its application in grayscale digit classification on the MNIST dataset

## Authors: Jingyuan Zhu, Anthony Hong, Ruiqi Wang, Mingzhen Li
Contributions: All authors contributed to the projectâ€™s problem formulation and initial literature review. They engaged in multiple in-person and online discussions and collaboratively created and rehearsed the presenta- tion. Mingzhen Li and Anthony Hong focused on studying existing literature, conducting mathematical inductions for the 2D Monge-Kantorovich Problem in solutions of primal and dual forms. Jingyuan Zhu and Ruiqi Wang concentrated on applying the solution to the MNIST dataset, analyzing the Gradient Descent Approach, conducting experiments, and performing results and complexity analysis.
